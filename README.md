# Wurfel Demo

Wurfel is a 1v1 board-game were you fight with die (Die is the plural of dice, in case you are confused). Currently only local multiplayer is supported and yes, you can just play against yourself.

How to play

Your goal is to reach 20 points before your opponent. Each round you will be able to choose from one of three die, by clicking on them. Click and hold to aim your dice onto the board and let go to launch. Different dice have different effects, which are listed below. At the end of each round, the values for all die on your side of the arena are counted together. If its above 20, you win.

Regular (gray): Just adds points, nothing special.
Bouncy (pink): Like regular but bouncy.
Gold: Double points.
Bad (red): Subtracts points instead of adding.
Sticky (green): Sticks to other die.
Boom (black): Blows up, pushing other die away. Force depends on rolled number.
Grow (yellow): Changes size and weight depending on rolled number.
Die that fall of the board dissappear. The die you don't use during your turn will be there on your next one.

This is my entry for the 2022 GMTK gamejam and only a demo of what the game could be. Image how cool it could be with proper multiplayer, audio, "deck building" and hundreds of different die. Let me know if I should keep working on it.
